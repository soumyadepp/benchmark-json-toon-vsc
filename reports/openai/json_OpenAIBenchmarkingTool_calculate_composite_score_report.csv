gpt-4o,JSON,calculate_composite_score,10.31056809425354,3023,1248,1251,2499,"To find the composite score for each Avenger, we use the formula provided:

\[ \text{score} = \text{attack} \times 0.3 + \text{defense} \times 0.25 + \text{speed} \times 0.2 + \text{intelligence} \times 0.15 + \text{tech} \times 0.1 \]

Let's calculate the composite score for each Avenger based on the data provided:

1. **Iron Man**:
   \[
   \text{score} = 80 \times 0.3 + 90 \times 0.25 + 75 \times 0.2 + 100 \times 0.15 + 100 \times 0.1 = 24 + 22.5 + 15 + 15 + 10 = 86.5
   \]
   Reasoning: Iron Man has high intelligence and tech, significantly contributing to his composite score.

2. **Captain America**:
   \[
   \text{score} = 90 \times 0.3 + 95 \times 0.25 + 80 \times 0.2 + 70 \times 0.15 + 60 \times 0.1 = 27 + 23.75 + 16 + 10.5 + 6 = 83.25
   \]
   Reasoning: Captain America's score is strong due to high attack and defense.

3. **Thor**:
   \[
   \text{score} = 95 \times 0.3 + 85 \times 0.25 + 70 \times 0.2 + 60 \times 0.15 + 25 \times 0.1 = 28.5 + 21.25 + 14 + 9 + 2.5 = 75.25
   \]
   Reasoning: Thor's high attack is offset by lower tech and intelligence.

4. **Hulk**:
   \[
   \text{score} = 100 \times 0.3 + 80 \times 0.25 + 60 \times 0.2 + 50 \times 0.15 + 30 \times 0.1 = 30 + 20 + 12 + 7.5 + 3 = 72.5
   \]
   Reasoning: Hulk's score comes primarily from his maximum attack.

5. **Black Widow**:
   \[
   \text{score} = 75 \times 0.3 + 70 \times 0.25 + 85 \times 0.2 + 80 \times 0.15 + 65 \times 0.1 = 22.5 + 17.5 + 17 + 12 + 6.5 = 75.5
   \]
   Reasoning: Balanced stats across all categories contribute to Black Widow's score.

6. **Ant Man**:
   \[
   \text{score} = 70 \times 0.3 + 65 \times 0.25 + 90 \times 0.2 + 85 \times 0.15 + 80 \times 0.1 = 21 + 16.25 + 18 + 12.75 + 8 = 76
   \]
   Reasoning: Ant Man benefits from high speed, intelligence, and tech scores.

7. **Hawkeye**:
   \[
   \text{score} = 80 \times 0.3 + 60 \times 0.25 + 85 \times 0.2 + 75 \times 0.15 + 50 \times 0.1 = 24 + 15 + 17 + 11.25 + 5 = 72.25
   \]
   Reasoning: Hawkeye has a balanced mix but lacks in defense and tech.

8. **Scarlet Witch**:
   \[
   \text{score} = 85 \times 0.3 + 70 \times 0.25 + 75 \times 0.2 + 90 \times 0.15 + 40 \times 0.1 = 25.5 + 17.5 + 15 + 13.5 + 4 = 75.5
   \]
   Reasoning: High attack and intelligence give Scarlet Witch a solid score.

9. **Vision**:
   \[
   \text{score} = 90 \times 0.3 + 85 \times 0.25 + 80 \times 0.2 + 95 \times 0.15 + 100 \times 0.1 = 27 + 21.25 + 16 + 14.25 + 10 = 88.5
   \]
   Reasoning: Vision excels with high scores in all categories.

10. **Doctor Strange**:
    \[
    \text{score} = 85 \times 0.3 + 80 \times 0.25 + 70 \times 0.2 + 100 \times 0.15 + 50 \times 0.1 = 25.5 + 20 + 14 + 15 + 5 = 79.5
    \]
    Reasoning: Intelligence and attack contribute most to Doctor Strange's score.

11. **Spiderman**:
    \[
    \text{score} = 80 \times 0.3 + 70 \times 0.25 + 90 \times 0.2 + 90 \times 0.15 + 90 \times 0.1 = 24 + 17.5 + 18 + 13.5 + 9 = 82
    \]
    Reasoning: Spiderman's overall high and consistent stats result in a strong composite score."
