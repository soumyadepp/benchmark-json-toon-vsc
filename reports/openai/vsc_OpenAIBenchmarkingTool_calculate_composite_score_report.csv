gpt-4o,VSC,calculate_composite_score,11.796952247619629,3088,654,1280,1934,"To calculate the composite score for each Avenger, we will use the given formula:

\[ \text{score} = (\text{attack} \times 0.3) + (\text{defence} \times 0.25) + (\text{speed} \times 0.2) + (\text{intelligence} \times 0.15) + (\text{tech} \times 0.1) \]

Below are the calculations and reasoning for each Avenger:

1. **Iron Man**: 
   \[ \text{score} = (80 \times 0.3) + (90 \times 0.25) + (75 \times 0.2) + (100 \times 0.15) + (100 \times 0.1) = 24 + 22.5 + 15 + 15 + 10 = 86.5 \]
   Reasoning: Iron Man has high intelligence and tech, which contribute significantly to his score.

2. **Captain America**:
   \[ \text{score} = (90 \times 0.3) + (95 \times 0.25) + (80 \times 0.2) + (70 \times 0.15) + (60 \times 0.1) = 27 + 23.75 + 16 + 10.5 + 6 = 83.25 \]
   Reasoning: High attack and defense skills are key to Captain America's score.

3. **Thor**:
   \[ \text{score} = (95 \times 0.3) + (85 \times 0.25) + (70 \times 0.2) + (60 \times 0.15) + (25 \times 0.1) = 28.5 + 21.25 + 14 + 9 + 2.5 = 75.25 \]
   Reasoning: Thor's exceptional attack power is offset by lower intelligence and tech.

4. **Hulk**:
   \[ \text{score} = (100 \times 0.3) + (80 \times 0.25) + (60 \times 0.2) + (50 \times 0.15) + (30 \times 0.1) = 30 + 20 + 12 + 7.5 + 3 = 72.5 \]
   Reasoning: Hulk's top attack is diluted by his lower intelligence and tech scores.

5. **Black Widow**:
   \[ \text{score} = (75 \times 0.3) + (70 \times 0.25) + (85 \times 0.2) + (80 \times 0.15) + (65 \times 0.1) = 22.5 + 17.5 + 17 + 12 + 6.5 = 75.5 \]
   Reasoning: Black Widow's balanced attributes yield a competitive overall score.

6. **Ant Man**:
   \[ \text{score} = (70 \times 0.3) + (65 \times 0.25) + (90 \times 0.2) + (85 \times 0.15) + (80 \times 0.1) = 21 + 16.25 + 18 + 12.75 + 8 = 76 \]
   Reasoning: High speed, intelligence, and tech elevate Ant Man's score.

7. **Hawkeye**:
   \[ \text{score} = (80 \times 0.3) + (60 \times 0.25) + (85 \times 0.2) + (75 \times 0.15) + (50 \times 0.1) = 24 + 15 + 17 + 11.25 + 5 = 72.25 \]
   Reasoning: High speed and balanced skills contribute to a moderate score for Hawkeye.

8. **Scarlet Witch**:
   \[ \text{score} = (85 \times 0.3) + (70 \times 0.25) + (75 \times 0.2) + (90 \times 0.15) + (40 \times 0.1) = 25.5 + 17.5 + 15 + 13.5 + 4 = 75.5 \]
   Reasoning: Strong attack, intelligence, and defense balance out tech limitations.

9. **Vision**:
   \[ \text{score} = (90 \times 0.3) + (85 \times 0.25) + (80 \times 0.2) + (95 \times 0.15) + (100 \times 0.1) = 27 + 21.25 + 16 + 14.25 + 10 = 88.5 \]
   Reasoning: Vision's advanced AI and tech provide a top-tier score.

10. **Doctor Strange**:
    \[ \text{score} = (85 \times 0.3) + (80 \times 0.25) + (70 \times 0.2) + (100 \times 0.15) + (50 \times 0.1) = 25.5 + 20 + 14 + 15 + 5 = 79.5 \]
    Reasoning: Intelligence and defense heavily weight Doctor Strange's score.

11. **Spiderman**:
    \[ \text{score} = (80 \times 0.3) + (70 \times 0.25) + (90 \times 0.2) + (90 \times 0.15) + (90 \times 0.1) = 24 + 17.5 + 18 + 13.5 + 9 = 82 \]
    Reasoning: High speed and intelligence boost Spiderman's competitive score."
