Reason: Based on the dataset, Thor possesses extremely high strength and the power of thunder, reflected in his 95 strength attribute. Spider-Man, while agile with high intelligence and reflexes, has lower overall power levels (strength 80 compared to Thor's 95). Additionally, Thor wields the enchanted hammer Mjolnir, which adds significant combat power. Given Thor's attributes and weaponry, he would likely overpower Spider-Man in a direct confrontation."

Reason: Based on the dataset, Thor demonstrates superior capability in strength (95) compared to Spiderman (80). Though Spiderman has high agility and intelligence, Thor's status as the God of Thunder who wields the enchanted hammer Mjolnir may give him supernatural abilities that contribute more to a fight, especially since Spiderman's main strength lies in wall-crawling and spider-sense, which may not be very effective against an opponent like Thor."
gpt-5.1,VSC,can_avenger_defeat_avenger,3.4810631275177,551,631,128,759,"Can Defeat: Yes  
Reason: According to the data, Thor has higher strength (95 vs 80) and comparable or sufficient agility (85 vs 70). While Spiderman has higher intelligence (90 vs 70), higher technology (90 vs 25), and better durability (90 vs 70), Thor is explicitly described as the “God of Thunder” and wields the enchanted hammer Mjolnir, giving him powerful offensive capabilities beyond raw stats. Based strictly on the listed attributes and descriptions, Thor’s superior strength and god-level power set indicate he can defeat Spiderman."
