Reason: Based on the provided data, Thor has a higher attack stat (95) compared to Spiderman's (80), and also possesses the power of being a ""God of Thunder,"" which likely gives him an advantage in terms of raw power and the potential use of his enchanted hammer, Mjolnir. These attributes suggest that Thor is likely more powerful in a direct confrontation, despite Spiderman's agility and intelligence advantages."

Reason: Based on the provided data, Thor has a higher attack power (95) than Spiderman's defense (70). Additionally, Thor's defense (85) could likely withstand Spiderman's attack (80). Even though Spiderman has superior speed (90 vs. 70) and intelligence (90 vs. 60), Thor's powers as the God of Thunder might bring additional unseen advantages in combat that go beyond just stats."

Reason: Thor has higher attack (95 vs 80) and defense (85 vs 70), making him more powerful and durable in direct combat. While Spiderman is faster (90 vs 70) and matches or exceeds Thor in intelligence and tech, the data lists Thor as the “God of Thunder” with superior raw combat stats, which would likely allow him to overpower Spiderman in a head‑on battle."
