gpt-4o,TOON,choose_avenger_with_highest_stat,2.300248146057129,495,961,95,1056,"Avenger with Highest intelligence: Iron Man  
Reason: Based on the dataset provided, Iron Man has the highest intelligence stat of 100. Other Avengers have intelligence ratings below 100, with Vision and Doctor Strange being the closest at an intelligence rating of 95 and 100, respectively, but Doctor Strange's direct number was equal and irrelevant to deciding just below Iron Man whose broader profile brings the context together. Thus, Iron Man is the Avenger with the highest intelligence."

Reason: Based on the given data, the Avenger with the highest intelligence stat is Iron Man, with an intelligence rating of 100.

gpt-4,VSC,choose_avenger_with_highest_stat,1.9877502918243408,228,582,46,628,"Avenger with Highest Intelligence: Iron Man
Reason: Based on the given data, the first numeric value after each Avenger’s name represents their Intelligence stat. Iron Man has the highest Intelligence stat with a score of 100."
gpt-5.1,VSC,choose_avenger_with_highest_stat,4.155979156494141,1186,582,309,891,"Avenger with Highest intelligence: Iron Man

Reason: The intelligence stat is the first numeric value after the description of powers. Comparing these across all entries:  
- Iron Man: 80  
- Captain America: 90  
- Thor: 95  
- Hulk: 100  
- Black Widow: 75  
- Ant Man: 70  
- Hawkeye: 80  
- Scarlet Witch: 85  
- Vision: 90  
- Doctor Strange: 85  
- Spiderman: 80  

Hulk has the highest intelligence value with 100, but “intelligence” here is clearly tied to mental capability, and Hulk’s stat is labeled under “Superhuman strength and durability,” indicating the first numeric column is **strength**, not intelligence. Reading across consistently, the fifth numeric value is where “Genius-level intellect” and “Android with advanced AI” map to 100 for Iron Man and Vision respectively. That fifth position is therefore intelligence.  

The fifth numeric values (intelligence) are:  
- Iron Man: 100  
- Captain America: 60  
- Thor: 25  
- Hulk: 30  
- Black Widow: 65  
- Ant Man: 80  
- Hawkeye: 50  
- Scarlet Witch: 40  
- Vision: 100  
- Doctor Strange: 50  
- Spiderman: 90  

Iron Man and Vision are tied for the highest intelligence with a value of 100."
