gpt-4o,JSON,can_avenger_defeat_avenger,2.503471851348877,411,1226,96,1322,"Can Defeat: Yes  
Reason: Based on the given dataset, Thor possesses formidable powers as the ""God of Thunder"" and wields the enchanted hammer Mjolnir. Thor has a higher attack (95) and defense (85) compared to Spiderman's attack (80) and defense (70). While Spiderman has superior speed (90) and intelligence (90), Thor's overall god-like power and high attack stats give him an edge in a direct confrontation."
gpt-4,JSON,can_avenger_defeat_avenger,4.7534778118133545,620,1209,120,1329,"Can Defeat: Yes
Reason: The provided data tells us that Thor has superior attack and defense scores as compared to Spiderman, which suggests increased physical prowess. Spiderman does have higher speed, intelligence, and tech scores, but Thor's powers, including his status as the God of Thunder and his access to Mjolnir, suggest that he would likely overpower Spiderman in a contest of combat, despite the latter's advantageous characteristics. Thor's lower intelligence and tech scores likely wouldn't pose significant disadvantages in a one-on-one fight with Spiderman, given their general combat-oriented abilities."
gpt-5.1,JSON,can_avenger_defeat_avenger,1.9810171127319336,375,1225,97,1322,"Can Defeat: Yes  
Reason: Thor has higher attack (95 vs 80) and defense (85 vs 70), and his power is described as “God of Thunder” versus Spiderman’s street-level abilities. While Spiderman is faster (90 vs 70) and highly intelligent/tech-savvy, Thor’s superior raw combat stats and god-level power give him the advantage in a direct fight based on the provided data."
gpt-4o,TOON,can_avenger_defeat_avenger,3.346057891845703,542,1010,118,1128,"Can Defeat: Yes  
Reason: Based on the data provided, Thor has a higher attack stat (95) compared to Spiderman's attack (80) and greater defense (85 vs. 70). Although Spiderman possesses higher speed (90 vs. 70) and equal intelligence (90), Thor's power as the ""God of Thunder"" and his wielding of the enchanted hammer Mjolnir suggest an overwhelming advantage in raw strength and combat capabilities. The combination of Thor’s superior attack and his powerful abilities gives him the potential to defeat Spiderman in a hypothetical battle."
gpt-4,TOON,can_avenger_defeat_avenger,3.678129196166992,398,1010,84,1094,"Can Defeat: Yes
Reason: Based on the data presented, Thor has higher attack and defense stats compared to Spiderman significantly. Thor's attack is at 95 while Spiderman's defense is at 70, indicating that Thor could potentially overpower Spiderman. Even though Spiderman has higher speed, intelligence, and tech skills, Thor's raw power advantage may be the defining factor in a one-on-one battle."
gpt-5.1,TOON,can_avenger_defeat_avenger,2.877032995223999,418,1009,105,1114,"Can Defeat: Yes  
Reason: Thor has higher attack (95 vs 80) and defense (85 vs 70) than Spiderman, and his power is described as “God of Thunder” with the enchanted hammer Mjolnir, implying significantly greater raw combat power. Spiderman is faster (90 vs 70) and very intelligent/tech-savvy, but nothing in the data suggests his abilities can overcome Thor’s superior strength and durability in a direct fight."
gpt-4o,VSC,can_avenger_defeat_avenger,2.7587578296661377,557,632,117,749,"Can Defeat: Yes  
Reason: According to the dataset, Thor is described as the ""God of Thunder"" and has attributes such as superhuman strength. He wields the enchanted hammer Mjolnir, which significantly enhances his combat abilities. His power (95) and durability (85) are superior compared to Spiderman’s corresponding attributes (80 power, 70 durability). Moreover, Thor's godly status and combat experience give him a significant advantage in battle over Spiderman, who, while agile and capable, lacks the godlike power and weaponry that Thor possesses."
gpt-4,VSC,can_avenger_defeat_avenger,3.898998975753784,490,632,100,732,"Can Defeat: Yes
Reason: Based on the data, Thor seems to have superior attributes in comparison to Spiderman. Thor has a higher rating in strength and agility, which could potentially give him an advantage during the battle. While Spiderman does have a high score in agility and intelligence, Thor is the God of Thunder and also wields the enchanted hammer Mjolnir that gives him additional powers. Based on these attributes, it can be inferred that Thor could potentially defeat Spiderman."
gpt-5.1,VSC,can_avenger_defeat_avenger,2.1408138275146484,349,631,90,721,"Can Defeat: Yes  
Reason: Thor has higher strength (95 vs 80) and durability (85 vs 70), making him physically superior. While Spiderman is more agile (90 vs 70) and has high intelligence (90 vs 25), Thor’s status as “God of Thunder” and overall power stats suggest a clear advantage in a direct battle based solely on the provided attributes."
