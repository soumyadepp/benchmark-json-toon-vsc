Reasoning: The composite score is calculated using the formula: (attack*0.3) + (defence*0.25) + (speed*0.2) + (intelligence*0.15) + (tech*0.1). For Hawkeye, this is (80*0.3) + (60*0.25) + (85*0.2) + (75*0.15) + (50*0.1) = 24 + 15 + 17 + 11.25 + 5 = 72.25.

Scarlet Witch: 75.5
Reasoning: The composite score is calculated using the formula: (attack*0.3) + (defence*0.25) + (speed*0.2) + (intelligence*0.15) + (tech*0.1). For Scarlet Witch, this is (85*0.3) + (70*0.25) + (75*0.2) + (90*0.15) + (40*0.1) = 25.5 + 17.5 + 15 + 13.5 + 4 = 75.5.

Vision: 88.5
Reasoning: The composite score is calculated using the formula: (attack*0.3) + (defence*0.25) + (speed*0.2) + (intelligence*0.15) + (tech*0.1). For Vision, this is (90*0.3) + (85*0.25) + (80*0.2) + (95*0.15) + (100*0.1) = 27 + 21.25 + 16 + 14.25 + 10 = 88.5.

Doctor Strange: 79.5
Reasoning: The composite score is calculated using the formula: (attack*0.3) + (defence*0.25) + (speed*0.2) + (intelligence*0.15) + (tech*0.1). For Doctor Strange, this is (85*0.3) + (80*0.25) + (70*0.2) + (100*0.15) + (50*0.1) = 25.5 + 20 + 14 + 15 + 5 = 79.5.

Spiderman: 82.0
Reasoning: The composite score is calculated using the formula: (attack*0.3) + (defence*0.25) + (speed*0.2) + (intelligence*0.15) + (tech*0.1). For Spiderman, this is (80*0.3) + (70*0.25) + (90*0.2) + (90*0.15) + (90*0.1) = 24 + 17.5 + 18 + 13.5 + 9 = 82.0.",0.00424
