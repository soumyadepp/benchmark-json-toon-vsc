gemini-2.5-flash,TOON,CAN_AVENGER_DEFEAT_AVENGER,5.872626781463623,513,1087,131,2048,"Can Defeat: Yes
Reason: Thor possesses significantly higher attack (95 vs 80) and defense (85 vs 70) stats compared to Spiderman. His power is described as ""God of Thunder"" and he wields Mjolnir, indicating a higher tier of raw power. While Spiderman has superior speed (90 vs 70), intelligence (90 vs 60), and tech (90 vs 25), Thor's overwhelming offensive and defensive capabilities, combined with his inherent power, suggest he has the capacity to defeat Spiderman despite Spiderman's agility and spider-sense."
