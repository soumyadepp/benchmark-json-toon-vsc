Reason: Based on the stats, Thor has a higher attack (95) and defense (85) compared to Spiderman's attack (80) and defense (70). However, Spiderman has higher speed (90), intelligence (90), and tech (90) compared to Thor's speed (70), intelligence (60), and tech (25). It is not clear if Thor's ""God of Thunder"" power can overcome Spiderman's advantages.

Reason: Thor has significantly higher attack (95 vs 80) and defense (85 vs 70) stats compared to Spiderman. While Spiderman has superior speed (90 vs 70), intelligence (90 vs 60), and tech (90 vs 25), Thor's power as the ""God of Thunder"" and his higher combat-oriented stats suggest he possesses the raw power to overcome Spiderman's agility and evasiveness."

Reason: Thor's attack stat (95) is higher than Spiderman's defense stat (70). Thor also has the power of God of Thunder.

Reason: Thor has significantly higher attack (95 vs 80) and defense (85 vs 70) stats compared to Spiderman. While Spiderman is faster (90 vs 70) and more intelligent (90 vs 60), Thor's ""God of Thunder"" power combined with his superior raw combat stats indicates he has the destructive capability to defeat Spiderman."

Reason: Thor's speed (25) is significantly lower than Spiderman's (90). Combined with Spiderman's high agility (70) and ""spider-sense"" ability, Spiderman would be extremely difficult for Thor to hit. While Thor has superior strength and the ""God of Thunder"" ability, his inability to land a decisive blow on a much faster and more agile opponent with precognition makes it unlikely he could defeat Spiderman."
