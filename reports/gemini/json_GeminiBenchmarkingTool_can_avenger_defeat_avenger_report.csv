Reason: Thor has significantly higher attack (95 vs 80) and defense (85 vs 70) compared to Spiderman. While Spiderman has higher speed (90 vs 70) and intelligence (90 vs 60), Thor's power as the ""God of Thunder"" and wielding the enchanted hammer Mjolnir, combined with his superior offensive and defensive stats, indicate he possesses the raw power to overcome Spiderman's agility and spider-sense."

Reason: According to the provided data, Thor has a significant advantage in the primary combat stats. Thor's attack is 95 and his defense is 85, which are both higher than Spiderman's attack of 80 and defense of 70. While Spiderman has superior speed (90 vs. 70), Thor's higher attack and defense values suggest he could withstand Spiderman's offense and deliver a more powerful, decisive blow."
