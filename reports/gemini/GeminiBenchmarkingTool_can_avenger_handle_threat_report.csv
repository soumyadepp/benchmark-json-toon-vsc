Reason: Doctor Strange possesses ""Mastery of the mystic arts"" and is described as the ""Sorcerer Supreme to protect the world."" While the data does not explicitly detail his ability to travel across dimensions or counter such travel, the nature of mystic arts and his role as Sorcerer Supreme strongly imply capabilities related to understanding and manipulating interdimensional phenomena. This would allow him to confront, contain, or banish an alien capable of dimensional travel. His high intelligence (100) would also be beneficial in strategizing against such a complex threat. The ""huge strong"" aspect of the alien could be addressed through the various non-physical means available via his mystic arts."
