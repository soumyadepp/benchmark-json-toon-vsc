Reason: Thor possesses superior strength (95 vs 80) and speed (85 vs 70) compared to Spiderman. His abilities as the ""God of Thunder"" and wielding Mjolnir imply a level of offensive power that would likely overwhelm Spiderman's defenses, despite Spiderman's higher durability (90 vs 70), fighting skills (90 vs 25), and spider-sense. While Spiderman's agility and spider-sense would make him difficult to hit, a direct strike from Thor's immense strength or a powerful ""God of Thunder"" attack would be devastating."

Reason: Based on the data, Thor has superior scores in Strength (95 vs. 80) and Agility (85 vs. 70). Furthermore, Thor is described as the ""God of Thunder,"" which suggests a higher power level than Spiderman, who has ""spider-like abilities."" While Spiderman has higher scores in Combat, Intelligence, and Technology, Thor's significant advantages in physical attributes and his divine nature give him the overall edge."
